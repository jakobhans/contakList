contakList
==========

App Description
---------------

contakList is an HTML5 web app originally developed for the 10: An Event Apart contest but withdrawn for the entries due to domain/localStorage trouble. Anyway, it works great in a domain or subodomain of its own (meaning no localStorage is shared). Created with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Files
-----

+ css/style.css - Basic CSS stylesheet. Doesn't affect the inner workings of the app. Edit as you wish :)
+ index.html - Half of the app. The markup and some CSS rules implied to make the script work.
+ js/dynamics.js - JavaScript file. As simple as that ;)
